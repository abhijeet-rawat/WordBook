## How WordBook Works?

   We believe that Vocab Learning can be made more efficient with the personalization & tailoring to the User needs. Learning new words requires lot's of constistent practice and suggesting words of difficutly similar to what user has learned can add some cherry on this cake.

   **Hey, but wait a minute ... What is meant by difficulty of a word? Have we gone mad or sleep deprived?** 
   
   No, we are fine, atleast for now. Actually difficulty of a word is a context-based concept. Let's consider an example to understand this better, consider two people, Elon & Steve, and
     - Elon feels that words like 'Tesla', 'HyperLoop' & 'Self-Driving Cars' are easy for him as he loves them and deals with them all the time.
     - On the other hands for Steve word 'Tesla' seems difficult to him, while term like "Apple" is easy for him.
    Hence, it's all about perpective and our domains of studies, surroundings and profession. For simplicity we have classified difficulty levels into three dom
   **Okay! I understand that so called 'word-difficulty concept', then what does WordBook is all about?**
   
   WordBook enhances the Vocabulary Learning process by personalizing, reciation features, games, history and lot more. It also provides word recommendation by learning from user history and choice of words.
